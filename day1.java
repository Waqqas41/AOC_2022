/** solution brainstorm and pseudocode:
basic idea: 
find the elf with the most calories in his backpack. 
each elf's inventory is separated by a blank line
the total calories per elf is the sum of integer values 
in an elfs inventory 
//

pseudocode:
print textfile to console for testing
input textfile and read through each line
    while (file value != an empty line){
    add all integer values separated by a line to an int inventory 
    }

    inventory = new variable current inventory 

    create a new Node and add it to a linked list every time the while loop breaks 

    if (we reach EOF){
        return linked list
        print linked list
    }

    sort method {
        
    }
